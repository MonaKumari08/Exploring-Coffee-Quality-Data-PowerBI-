# Power BI - Capstone Project: Exploring Coffee Quality Data

## Project Overview

This Capstone Project focuses on exploring and analyzing coffee quality data with Power BI. The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing coffee quality using the data provided by the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), a non-profit organization dedicated to improving coffee quality worldwide.

## About the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)

The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) is a non-profit organization that works to improve the quality and value of coffee globally. Established in 1996, with its headquarters in California, USA, CQIâ€™s mission is to enhance coffee quality through research, training, and certification programs. The organization collaborates with coffee growers, processors, roasters, and other stakeholders to promote sustainability and develop the specialty coffee industry.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various factors that affect coffee quality, such as:

### Sensory Evaluations (Coffee Quality Scores)
- **Aroma**: The fragrance or scent of the coffee.
- **Flavor**: The taste, including sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and other flavor notes.
- **Aftertaste**: The lingering taste remaining after swallowing the coffee.
- **Acidity**: The brightness or liveliness of the taste.
- **Body**: The thickness or viscosity of the coffee in the mouth.
- **Balance**: How well the different flavor components of the coffee work together.
- **Uniformity**: The consistency of the coffee from cup to cup.
- **Clean Cup**: Coffee free from off-flavors or defects.
- **Sweetness**: Desirable qualities like caramel-like, fruity, or floral sweetness.

The **Total Cup Points** represent the sum of all the sensory evaluations, indicating the overall coffee quality.

### Defects
- **Category One Defects**: Primary defects visible through inspection (e.g., black beans, insect-damaged beans).
- **Category Two Defects**: Secondary defects detectable through tasting (e.g., over-fermentation, rancidness).

## Research Questions

The main objectives of this project are to explore the following research questions:

1. What are the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes such as aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.?
2. Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?
3. Can we identify trends or patterns in defect occurrences and their impact on overall coffee quality?
4. How do different variables interact to influence the **Total Cup Points**, the overall measure of coffee quality?

## Objective of the Project

The goal is to leverage Power BI to:
- Analyze coffee quality scores across various sensory attributes.
- Explore relationships between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality.
- Examine defect occurrences and their correlation with coffee quality.
- Visualize and understand how multiple factors contribute to **Total Cup Points**.

### NOTE:
- Thoroughly explore the dataset and documentation.
- Feel free to experiment with different scenarios based on **What-If Analysis** in Power BI.
- Use a wide range of visualizations and formulas to enhance the data analysis.

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Import**: Import the coffee quality dataset into Power BI.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure that it's ready for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze key patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset using Power BI visualizations.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate the correlations between different variables such as sensory attributes, processing methods, origin regions, and defects.
5. **Trend Analysis**: Identify any patterns in coffee quality over time or across different regions and processes.
6. **What-If Analysis**: Perform scenario analysis to understand how changes in key variables affect the **Total Cup Points**.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing coffee quality and help understand how sensory attributes, defects, and other variables correlate with the overall coffee quality. The analysis will guide coffee producers and enthusiasts in identifying the key drivers of high-quality coffee.
